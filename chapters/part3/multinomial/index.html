<center><h1>Multinomial</h1></center>
<hr/>

<p>The multinomial is an example of a <i>parametric</i> distribution for multiple random variables. The multinomial is a gentle introduction to joint distributions. It is a extension of the binomial. In both cases, you have $n$ independent experiments. In a binomial each outcome is a "success" or "not success". In a multinomial there can be more than two outcomes (multi). A great analogy for the multinomial is: we are going to roll an $m$ sided dice $n$ times. We care about reporting the number of outcomes of each side of your dice. </p>

<p>Here is the formal definition of the multinomial. Say you perform $n$ independent trials of an experiment where each trial results in one of $m$ outcomes, with respective probabilities: $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_m$ (constrained so that $\sum_i p_i = 1$). Define $X_i$ to be the number of trials with outcome $i$. A multinomial distribution is a closed form function that answers the question: What is the probability that there are $c_i$ trials with outcome $i$. Mathematically:
  \begin{align*}
          P(X_1=c_1,X_2 = c_2, \dots , X_m = c_m) &= { {n} \choose {c_1,c_2,\dots , c_m} }\cdot p_1^{c_1} \cdot p_2^{c_2}\dots p_m^{c_m} \\
          &=  { {n} \choose {c_1,c_2,\dots , c_m} }\cdot \prod_i p_i^{c_i} 
          \end{align*}
  
</p>

<p>This is our first joint random variable model! We can express it in a card, much like we would for random variables:</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>


<div class="purpleBox">
<b><i>Standard Dice Example:</b></i> A 6-sided die is rolled 7 times. What is the probability that you roll: 1 one, 1 two, 0 threes, 2 fours, 0 fives, 3 sixes (disregarding order).
\begin{align*}
\P(X_1=1,X_2 = 1&, X_3 = 0,X_4 = 2,X_5 = 0,X_6 = 3) \\&= \frac{7!}{2!3!}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^1\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^1\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3\\
&=420\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^7
\end{align*}
</div>

<div class="purpleBox">
  <b><i>Weather Example:</b></i> 
  
  <p>Each day the weather in Bayeslandia can be {Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy} where $p_\text{sunny} = 0.7$, $p_\text{cloudy} = 0.2$ and $p_\text{rainy} = 0.1$. Assume each day is independent of one another. What is the probability that over the next 7 days we have 6 sunny days, 1 cloudy day and 0 rainy days?
  \begin{align*}
  \P(X_{\text{sunny}}=6,X_{\text{rainy}} = 1&, X_{\text{cloudy}} = 0) \\
  &= \frac{7!}{6!1!} (0.7)^6 \cdot (0.2)^1 \cdot (0.1) ^0 \\
  &\approx 0.16
  \end{align*}
</p>

 <p>How does that compare to the probability that every day is sunny?

  \begin{align*}
  \P(X_{\text{sunny}}=7,X_{\text{rainy}} = 0&, X_{\text{cloudy}} = 0) \\
  &= \frac{7!}{7!1!} (0.7)^7 \cdot (0.2)^0 \cdot (0.1) ^0 \\
  &\approx 0.08
  \end{align*}

<p>The multinomial is especially popular because of its use as a model of language. For a full example see the <a href="{{pathToLang}}examples/federalist">Federalist Paper Authorship</a> example.</p>

<h3>Joint Probability</h3>

<p>A way to deeper understand the multinomial is to derive the joint probability function for a particular multinomial. Consider a multinomial with $n = 7$ outcomes where each outcome can be one of three values ${S,C,R}$   </p>
